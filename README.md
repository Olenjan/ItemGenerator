## Databases

User Database       - database of users, login and refers to instance database elements
Foundation Database - Foundational database defining core data and rules
Instance Database   - Instances generated based on foundational database

### Database design guidelines

1. When to use enum, column vs table
	We create a new X when an entry is ...
	* Enum
		- Not referenced
		- Small, fixed set of values
		- Rarely changed, only part of a major change
	* Column
		- Not referenced
		- An single variable value
		- Unique to each entry
	* Table
		- Referenced by other tables directly related to it
		- A structure of data
		- It affects a separate system


	

### User database
User database is for reference.

	- user_id

// Property definition

	// Modifier is a set of changes to properties
	// ...
	We have different types of properties (item, character, area)
		Example: 
			* items affix at certain tier modifies properties of the character who has the item equipped.
			
			* item affix at certain tier modifies properties of the item, and therefore the properties of the character who has the item equipped
				- "{0}% Increased attack speed" - Weapon attack speed is changed
				- "Adds {0} - {1} physical damage to attacks"
				
			* Area modifier at certain tier modifies properties of all monsters in the area
				- "{0}% Increased pack size"
				- "{0}% Increased number of Rare Monsters"
				- "Monster skills chain {0} additional times"
				- "Area is inhabited by {0}"
				- "Unique Boss has {0}% increased Life"
